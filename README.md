# WEB

A sample project exploring web crawling. I have crawled a portion of indeed.com, using JAVA, and Crawler4J. Forgive my horrid naming convention. 

I have originally conceived this little side project to get a raw dataset for my semantic web project and learn about Web Crawling and Maven in the process.
